## Article 1.0 - Purpose and Values 

### 1.1  Purpose

The purpose of the Maryland Pirate Party shall be to further the cause of freedom and unleash the power of individual creativity, through:

* increasing the power of individuals over corporations;

* increasing government transparency;

* protecting personal privacy;

* promoting open culture by limiting copyright and reducing its duration;

* promoting open innovation by eliminating patents.

### 1.2  Core Values

We believe that:

* People are important.   The most important measure of a society and government’s  success is the happiness of the people who live there.

* Everyone does better the better everyone does.  The happiest countries in the  world  have large middle  classes and small poor populations.   The most successful years of the  United States of America were in the days when the middle class was at  its largest.  The more people in the middle class, the more opportunity  there is for everyone.

* We must use the right tool for the right job.   The Maryland Pirate Party has no ideology beyond  efficacy.   If  markets are the most efficient way to meet a goal, then  we will  advocate the use of markets.  If government  policy is the most   efficient way to meet a goal, we will advocate for  government policy.   No tool that effectively meets the desired goal is  inconsiderately for   so-called moral reasons.

* We must beware of unintended consequences.   The best laid plans of mice and men always have the potential to be  steered awry.  Every new policy or decision should be reviewed and  revisited to  make sure that it is addressing the problem it was  intended to address, no more, and no less.  Although such a policy may  seem expensive, the negative effects of unintended  consequences are  much more so.

* Our decisions and efforts must be based on human equality, where equality and equal right to participate without discrimination is considered obvious. 

* We must use all nonviolent means to achieve our purpose including, but not limited to:  running candiates for office, engaging in issue advocacy and education, and ballot initiatives. 

* That members want to do what is right.  As such we trust our members and encourage them to take initiative and work to advance the party, even if that means, due to circumstances, not asking for permission first.  We expect that members will not do anything stupid and will consult with other members and/or party leadership when needed and depending on how the action will affect the party as a whole.

### 1.3 Party Platform

1.3.1  The party membership shall, through membership meetings, take positions and adopt  a platform of principles and positions on a number of policy issues and areas.
 
1.3.2  A proposal to amend the principle application can only be added by the bill or motion to the regular membership meeting. 

1.3.3  Modification of principle program requires at least three-quarters (3 / 4) of the votes to go through.

==== 1.4 Electronic communication ====

* electronic communication be tantamount to writing on paper;

* electronic attendance be equivalent to physical presence;

* the party leadership shall ensure that a secure system exists to carry out the above assertions.
